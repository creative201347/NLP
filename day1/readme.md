# Natural Langauge Processing || Day1

Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence in which computers analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.

**Nat­ur­al Lan­guage Pro­cessing is a field that cov­ers com­puter un­der­stand­ing and ma­nip­u­la­tion of hu­man lan­guage, and it’s ripe with pos­sib­il­it­ies for news­gath­er­ing**

NLP is used to analyze text, allowing machines to understand how humans speak. This human-computer interaction enables real-world applications like automatic text summarization, sentiment analysis, topic extraction, named entity recognition, parts-of-speech tagging, relationship extraction, stemming, and more. NLP is commonly used for text mining, machine translation, and automated question answering.

NLP is characterized as a difficult problem in computer science. Human language is rarely precise, or plainly spoken. To understand human language is to understand not only the words, but the concepts and how they’re linked together to create meaning. Despite language being one of the easiest things for the human mind to learn, the ambiguity of language is what makes natural language processing a difficult problem for computers to master.

- Summarize blocks of text using Summarizer to extract the most important and central ideas while ignoring irrelevant information.
- Create a chatbot using Parsey McParseface, a language parsing deep learning model made by Google that uses point-of-speech tagging.
- Generate keyword topic tags from a document using LDA (latent dirichlet allocation), which determines the most relevant words from a document. This algorithm is at the heart of the Auto-Tag and Auto-Tag URL microservices.
- Identify the type of entity extracted, such as it being a person, place, or organization using Named Entity Recognition.
- Sentiment Analysis, based on StanfordNLP, can be used to identify the feeling, opinion, or belief of a statement, from very negative, to neutral, to very positive. Often, developers will use an algorithm to identify the sentiment of a term in a sentence, or use sentiment analysis to analyze social media.
- Reduce words to their root, or stem, using PorterStemmer, or break up text into tokens using Tokenizer.
- Many brands track sentiment on social media and perform social media sentiment analysis. In social media sentiment analysis, brands track conversations online to understand what customers are saying, and glean insight into user behavior.
- Facebook uses NLP to track trending topics and popular hashtags.
- There are a wide range of additional business use cases for NLP, from customer service applications (such as automated support and chatbots) to user experience improvements (for example, website search and content curation). One field where NLP presents an especially big opportunity is finance, where many businesses are using it to automate manual processes and generate additional business value.
- Other practical uses of NLP include monitoring for malicious digital attacks, such as phishing, or detecting when somebody is lying. And NLP is also very helpful for web developers in any field, as it provides them with the turnkey tools needed to create advanced applications and prototypes.
